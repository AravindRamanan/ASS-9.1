1. Why MapReduce program is needed in Pig Programming?





--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. What are advantages of pig over MapReduce?

* Pig’s programming language referred to as Pig Latin is a coding approach that provides high degree of abstraction for MapReduce programming but is a procedural code not declarative. 
* Pig Latin code can be extended through various user defined functions that are written in Python, Java, Groovy, JavaScript, and Ruby. * Pig has tools for data storage, data execution and data manipulation. 
* Pig Latin is highly promoted by Yahoo as all the data engineers at Yahoo use Pig for processing data on the biggest hadoop clusters in the world.
* Pig has comparitively lesser lines of code than MapReduce.
* Development effort is less in pig than Mapreduce.
* Pig is simple to learn and use as compared to Map Reduce.

3. What is pig engine and what is its importance?

* Apache Pig has a component known as Pig Engine that accepts the Pig Latin scripts as input and converts those scripts into MapReduce jobs.

* Engine is one of the most important parts of the pig without which we can't 






* Pig provides an execution engine atop Hadoop which 
– Removes need for users to tune Hadoop for their needs.
– Insulates users from changes in Hadoop interfaces.






4. What are the modes of Pig execution?







5. What is grunt shell in Pig?








6. What are the features of Pig Latin language?
* Rich set of operators − It provides many operators to perform operations like join, sort, filer, etc.

* Ease of programming − Pig Latin is similar to SQL and it is easy to write a Pig script if you are good at SQL.

* Optimization opportunities − The tasks in Apache Pig optimize their execution automatically, so the programmers need to focus only on semantics of the language.

* Extensibility − Using the existing operators, users can develop their own functions to read, process, and write data.

* UDF’s − Pig provides the facility to create User-defined Functions in other programming languages such as Java and invoke or embed them in Pig Scripts.

* Handles all kinds of data − Apache Pig analyzes all kinds of data, both structured as well as unstructured. It stores the results in HDFS.

7. Is Pig latin commands case sensitive?

* The names (aliases) of relations and fields are case sensitive. 
* The names of Pig Latin functions are case sensitive. 
* The names of parameters and all other Pig Latin keywords (see Reserved Keywords) are case insensitive.

EXAMPLES: 

* The names (aliases) of relations A, B, and C are case sensitive.
* The names (aliases) of fields f1, f2, and f3 are case sensitive.
* Function names PigStorage and COUNT are case sensitive.
* Keywords LOAD, USING, AS, GROUP, BY, FOREACH, GENERATE, and DUMP are case insensitive. They can also be written as load, using, as, group, by, etc.
