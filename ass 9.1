* Ease of programming − Pig Latin is similar to SQL and it is easy to write a Pig script if you are good at SQL.

* Optimization opportunities − The tasks in Apache Pig optimize their execution automatically, so the programmers need to focus only on semantics of the language.

* Extensibility − Using the existing operators, users can develop their own functions to read, process, and write data.

* UDF’s − Pig provides the facility to create User-defined Functions in other programming languages such as Java and invoke or embed them in Pig Scripts.
